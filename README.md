## üöÄ Getting Started: Installation

Since this extension is not on the Chrome Web Store, you need to build it from the source and load it as an 'unpacked extension'.

### Prerequisites

* You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your machine.
* A code editor (like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/DiegoAndradeD/custom-hometab.git
    cd custom-hometab
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This will install React, Zustand, and all other necessary packages.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build the project:**
    This is the most important step. It will create a `dist` folder with all the optimized, static files for the Chrome extension.
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
    You should now have a new folder in your project named `dist`.

4.  **Load the extension in Chrome:**
    * Open your Google Chrome browser.
    * Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.
    * In the top-right corner, turn on **"Developer mode"**.
    * A new set of buttons will appear. Click on **"Load unpacked"**.
    * A file dialog will open. Navigate to your project directory and select the `dist` folder (the one created in step 3).
    * The "Custom-HomeTab" extension will now appear in your list of extensions and will be active.

5.  **Enjoy!**
    Open a new tab (Ctrl+T or Cmd+T) to see your new, custom dashboard.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

Once installed, simply open a new tab to see your dashboard.

* To customize the UI, hover over the **top-left corner** to find the settings menus.
* **Image Icon:** Click this to change your wallpaper, theme, and backdrop blur.
* **Settings Icon:** Click this to toggle widgets on or off and change their variants (like the clock format or search bar style).
